The source code for the DASFAA 2021 paper "Towards Entity Alignment in the Open World: An Unsupervised Approach"

We obtained the entity name embeddings (_vectorList.json) from [RDGCN](https://github.com/StephanieWyt/RDGCN)
You may also obtain from [here](https://share.weiyun.com/5qxLmEI).

The string_mat.npy stores the Levenshiten string distance, which can be obtained by performing stringsim.py.
